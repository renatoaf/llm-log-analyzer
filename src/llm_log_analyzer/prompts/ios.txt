- Linker errors and missing frameworks/libraries
- Code signing issues
- Provisioning profile problems
- Certificate and entitlement issues
- Bundle identifier conflicts
- Dependency resolution (CocoaPods, SPM, Carthage)
- Asset catalog compilation errors
- Info.plist configuration issues
- Module compatibility problems (Swift version mismatches)
- Bitcode issues
- Duplicate symbol errors
